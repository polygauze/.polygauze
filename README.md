# Animate Palace #
My offical webstie is up, again, because the original repl.co version got taken down due to replit's new hosting changes (they suck). So i've reopened it on github, with this being the official repo for it. Feel free to look around or check the website for fresh (or stale) animations!

NOTE: the original source code replit page exist along with my account in the EVER slight chance replit decides to change and for archival purposes
