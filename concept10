# Concept for video10 (effectest2)

Potential Video Length: 1:02

Idea
"Video will be upgrade from effects test including new effects, from the forms of water, fire, smoke, dust, clouds, fog, rain; whereas
the original only had effects on dust"

"Video will start off with flag waving in background while ball slams into ground at sideways angle, waits a second and then shoots off"
(dust)

"Next, ball will zip close to ground next to moving grass in horizontal postion at high speeds hitting a character, sending character flying"
(dust)

"After this, ball will slam into spring at upward postion, bouncing, sending it flying down"
(dust)
